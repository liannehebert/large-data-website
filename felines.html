	<p>Feline, or <i>felidae</i>, is the biological family of the cats; a member of this family is called a <i>felid</i>. The most familiar felid is the domestic cat. Felids are divided into two subfamilies: <i>pantherinae</i>—which includes the tiger, the lion, the jaguar, and the leopard; and <i>felinae</i>—which includes the cougar, the cheetah, the lynx, the ocelot, and the domestic cat. Of all the terrestrial families in the order <i>carnivora</i>, the felids are the strictest carnivores.</p>
