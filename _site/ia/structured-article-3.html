<p>The diminutive spectacled bear makes its home in the dense Andean jungles of South America, and it has the distinction of being the continentâ€™s only bear.</p>

<p>Intensely shy bears, they prefer the lush, isolated cloud forests on the slopes of the Andes, climbing as high as 14,000 feet (4,300 meters). They will descend to search for food though, and have been seen in widely differing habitats, from rain forests, to steppe lands, to coastal deserts.</p>
